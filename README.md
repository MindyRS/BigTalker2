Updated the original version to be utilized with the Sonos LAN Websocket DH. Until the author will update the orignal code.

Have you ever wanted a talking house? Now you can! With the Big Talker SmartApp!

When SmartThings is paired with a compatible audio device (such as a Sonos, Ubi, LANnouncer, VLCThing, AskAlexa, etc) and Big Talker SmartApp, your house can say what you want it to say when events occur.
